File Matcher
============

As silly as it seems, after searching for quite a while, I couldn't find a ruby script that would run through directories recursively and have the ability to do anything to a file, compare files, etc. So I wrote one, and figured I'd share the love.

This particular script runs an MD5 on each file and removes any duplicate files. This is particularly useful for getting rid of duplicate images (in iPhoto particularly, which has a very convoluted file structure -- the original reason for this script). But really, it can be used as a template for anything - the useful thing is the way that it runs through the files.
